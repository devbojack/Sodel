# ASSIGNMENT


A local transport company based in Nairobi, provides transport services for both passengers and parcels across major towns in Kenya, that is Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Garissa, Isiolo, Kericho, and Voi using their luxurious 11 seaters vans, 30 seaters mini buses and 55 seaters buses.

The cost of transporting a parcel is determined by the season, distance, urgency and security level needed. The fare for passengers is dependent on time and day, vehicle type and destination. Passengers book to travel a few hours before the trip begins and if cancellation is done, 25% of the paid amount is deducted as inconvenience fee and the remainder refunded to the passenger. The company doesn’t take any liabilities on parcels.

The company is in need of a system that will help them capture the full name, ID number and gender of the person paying for the trip, and the details of passengers travelling (Name, contact number if adult, next of kin contact number if minor, gender, destination, trip start time). A person can pay on their own behalf or can pay for others.

The system should have parent form showing details of the company, services offered and destinations covered. On clicking book a trip, the system should load a child form where details of the passenger (s) is captured and the seats number booked. On providing the details of all the passengers  (adults and minors if any), the system then asks for details of the person paying for the trip and computes the payment for both passengers and or parcel if present, and payment is made.

All these records are stored in a database. If a refund is needed, the system generate the details and computes the refund amount.
